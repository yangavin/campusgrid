# CampusGrid

CampusGrid is a specialized housing platform designed specifically for Queen's University students. The platform aggregates rental listings from multiple sources and presents them on an intuitive, interactive map interface.

## What It Does

CampusGrid simplifies the housing search for students by consolidating scattered listing information into a single, easy-to-navigate map view. Users can create personalized alerts to receive email notifications when new properties matching their specific criteria become available.

## Technical Implementation

Built on a modern serverless architecture using Firebase Functions, CampusGrid employs automated scrapers that run at scheduled intervals to keep listings current and relevant. The notification system leverages custom filtering algorithms to deliver updates to subscribed users.
